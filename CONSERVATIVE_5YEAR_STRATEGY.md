## ⚠️ Risk Warnings

### Drawdown Reality

**You WILL experience:**
```
Maximum Drawdown:    37.23% (tested)
Possible Drawdown:   40-45% (in extreme conditions)
```

**What this means:**
- $10,000 account could drop to $6,000
- $50,000 account could drop to $30,000
- $100,000 account could drop to $60,000

**You must be psychologically prepared for this.**

### Consecutive Losses

**At 5% risk per trade:**
```
3 consecutive losses  = -14.3% drawdown
5 consecutive losses  = -22.6% drawdown
7 consecutive losses  = -30.2% drawdown
10 consecutive losses = -40.1% drawdown
```

**You can survive 15+ consecutive losses before account risk.**

### Market Dependency

**2020-2024 was exceptional:**
- ✅ Bitcoin: $7K → $100K (14x)
- ✅ SOL: $10 → $260 (26x)
- ✅ Massive bull run (2020-2021)
- ✅ Strong recovery (2023-2024)

**Future may differ:**
- ❌ Extended bear markets
- ❌ Sideways consolidation
- ❌ Regulatory challenges
- ❌ Maturation = lower volatility

### Realistic Future Expectations

**Conservative Estimate**: 30-50% annualized
- Bear market periods
- Sideways consolidation
- Lower volatility

**Base Case**: 50-70% annualized
- Normal market cycles
- Continued crypto adoption
- Historical patterns hold

**Optimistic**: 70-90% annualized
- Strong bull markets
- High volatility continues
- SOL outperformance persists

**Reality Check**: Don't expect 78.60% every year. Plan for 40-60% long-term average.
